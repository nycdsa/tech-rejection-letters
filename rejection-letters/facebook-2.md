Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you for your interest, but Facebook operates in such a reprehensible way that does not match at all with my personal values.

I know you are aware of the following, but here are some examples:

It facilitates the spread of harmful disinformation, fanning the flames of hate and divisiveness.
Its stance on protecting freedom of speech indicates that it values metrics, data and "users" over protecting and uplifting democracy.
It violates user privacy, causes psychological harm, and takes advantage of and manipulates people to increase shareholder profit.
It really could impact the world for good but it chooses not to do so in a time of immense global crisis.

In short, Facebook is an unregulated, monopolist, greedy company for which I will never, ever consider working.

I appreciate you reaching out, but you can remove me from your list for any future opportunities. Good luck in your recruiting!

Sincerely,
[Ethical Candidate]
