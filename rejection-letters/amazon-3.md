Hi [Recruiter Name], thanks for reaching out, I really appreciate your interest! I'm [very happy | satisfied] in my position at [current company] right now and I'm not looking to move. Also, I am concerned with Amazon's business ethics (for example, [providing hosting services to Palantir](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802893/whole-foods-employees-amazon-ice-protest-palantir-facial-recognition)). I share this only in the hopes that Amazon realizes that these decisions impact their hiring pipeline. Take care and good luck.
