Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thanks for thinking of me for this role!

While I am delighted at [having been offered | being considered for] the position of [position here], I’m sorry to inform you that I must decline, as I cannot in good conscience work at a company as unethical as Uber.

The following is a list of reasons why I refuse to work for Uber.

- They've undermined local and state taxi regulations around the globe. Not just by aggressively entering markets and refusing to follow the law, but also via concerted technological efforts to undermine inspectors and regulators.
- They have a broken and hostile working environment, especially for women.
- Uber refuses to recognize it's drivers, without whom the company could not exist, as employees. Depriving them of a living wage, health care, or any benefits whatsoever.
- Uber has repeatedly jeopardized safety of its drivers and passengers around the globe.
- Former Senior Vice President Emil Michael publicly suggested the company should attack journalists who are critical of the company, going as far as to promote exposing the private life of a journalist who was particularly critical (Sarah Lacy).
- Uber is the largest of the so-called "Sharing/Gig Economy" (more accurately known as the "Servant Economy" or Serfdom 2.0) companies. These companies work to undermine labor laws in nearly every industry and country the world over.
- Despite the initial promise that ride-share services would be good for the environment and the urban landscape, cities that have allowed Uber have actually seen an increase in traffic and congestion. This increase can be directly attributed to the spread of ride-sharing.
- Uber engaged in strike breaking during the JFK airport taxi strike - an effort to stand in solidarity with people who were stranded after Trump's muslim ban went into effect. This anti-labor tone deafness led to hundreds of thousands of users to delete Uber.
- Uber has committed flagrant corporate espionage against it's chief competitor, Lyft.
- Uber spies on it's own users, and brags about it publicly, including once in a blog post about tracking user's "one night stands".
- Uber Lyon ran a blatantly sexist promotion promising to match male customers with "sexy" female drivers, with the tagline "Who said women don't know how to drive?"
- The entire business model of Uber is to establish a monopoly, via whatever means necessary. Despite this, the company won't be profitable until it can fully automate their system. Leaving the hundreds of thousands of drivers who built the company adrift.
- Uber imposes forced arbitration on all it's customers, for all complaints, even in the case of rape.

Again, thank you for reaching out about this opportunity. I’m grateful to be considered, but until Uber stops putting profit over people, I refuse to work for Uber.

Please pass this letter on to your manager.

Best,
[Your Name]
