Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thanks for thinking of me for this role!
While I am delighted at [having been offered | being considered for] the position of [position here], I’m terribly sorry to inform you that I must decline, as I cannot in good conscience work at a company as unethical as Facebook.

The following is a list of reasons why I refuse to work for Facebook.

- Facebook's policy of allowing political candidates to pay to promote false information.
- Mark Zuckerberg's troubling comments about "going to the mat" to fight efforts to break up Facebook and big tech companies.
- Facebook continually violates the privacy of users and non users. This includes the creation of so-called "Shadow Profiles", which exploit user data to build profiles on non-users and users alike.
- Facebook deliberately mislead users around the amount of data the company's Android app was using, the amount of data it was collecting from user email logins, the way it was using 2FA phone numbers, and on and on and on.
- Facebook allows advertisers to target users based on legally protected categories.
- Though Facebook recently increased contractor's wages, it still took a multi-year external effort to convince the company to treat contracted labor remotely fairly.
- Facebook aggressively moderates people of color while allowing white supremacists and other hate groups to remain on the platform.
- In the US (and elsewhere) Facebook is actively working to prevent and undermine laws protecting users' biometric data.

...and this is just the relatively recent set of stories.

Again, thank you for reaching out about this opportunity.

Please pass this letter on to your manager.

Best,
[Your Name]
